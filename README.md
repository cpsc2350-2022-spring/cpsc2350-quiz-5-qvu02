### Q1

git rebase will reapplies commits on top of another base branch, meanwhile merge joins two or more development histories together. In other words, the difference between merge and rebase is that while merge preserves history as the code was commited, rebase rewrites it. This in the long run can be either useful or problematic, respectively. For example, rebase problems may occur when the branch you are rebasing has already been published remotely got issues, and someone else has based their work on it. thus making it really hard to troubleshoot and fix the problem. Meanwhile, having to many logs from merge may confuse people who has never worked with the code commited by the original developers, which can also takes time and communications to solve.

### Q2

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows developers to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project
